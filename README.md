<h2>üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About Me:</h2>
I am a sophomore electrical engineering student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I am part of the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) Gifted Student Program, an academic scholarship awarded to exceptional Saudi students pursuing STEM majors in the US. I had a research internship at KAUST, where I worked on enhancing analog communication systems using software-defined radio techniques. Later, I participated with the said project at the International Science and Engineering Fair and won the K.Soumyanath special award. These experiences, along with my studies at UIUC, gained me skills in C/C++, python, SystemVerilog, digital systems design, probability, signal processing, and data structures. I am always looking forward to new experiences and opportunities.
